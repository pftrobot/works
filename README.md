# Junie's Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to showcase my projects and skills.

## Features

- Responsive design for all devices
- Dark mode support
- Sections for About Me, Projects, and Contact
- Clean and modern UI using Geist font

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev

# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm dev

# Using bun
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the portfolio.

## Customization

You can customize the portfolio by:

1. Updating the content in `app/page.tsx`
2. Modifying styles in `app/page.module.css` and `app/globals.css`
3. Adding your own projects and information

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a custom font from Vercel.
